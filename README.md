# Research Project at IT University of Copenhagen, Autumn 2020

**Project by:**

- Agnieszka Helena Zag√≥rna
- Gabriel Frederik Brodersen

**Project description:**
"The concept behind the app is to empower citizens to create and fill out reports of unparked and poorly placed e-scooters in the city, which can then be published to a service. It can help local governments by informing them about problem areas in the city and help the electric scooter companies find and clean up misplaced, vandalized, and poorly parked scooters." - from the exam report
